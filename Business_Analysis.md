The website will be delivered and installed on the server once it has been developed and tested.
## 6.2 Preliminary Deployment Concept 
The website will be validated through user testing and acceptance testing before it is deployed. The website will be introduced into operations once it has been approved by the gymnastics club.
## 6.3 Preliminary Support Concept 
The website will be supported by the web development company. This support will include regular maintenance and updates, as well as troubleshooting and support for any issues that arise.
## 6.4 Preliminary Retirement Concept 
The website will be retired when it is no longer needed by the gymnastics club. The data will be archived or deleted as appropriate.
